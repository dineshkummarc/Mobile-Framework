[Integralist](http://www.integralist.co.uk/) - Basic Mobile Framework (with help from Zepto.js & History.js)
================================

Description
-----------

I don't intend this to go anywhere as I can't feasible try and attempt what jQuery Mobile is doing by targeting as many devices as possible, so the only alternative would be to build a framework that works within the realm of WebKit based devices (with the understanding that all WebKit mobile engines are not the same).

My main branch will try and achieve this by building my own framework, but this branch will attempt to incorporate Zepto.js and History.js
